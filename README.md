# DevOps Engineer - technical pre-test
We think infrastructure is best represented as code, and provisioning of resources should be automated as much as possible.

Your task is to provision a load balancer and an Elasticsearch cluster with three nodes in it. You are free to use any provisioning tool and target of your choice. We tend to use Terraform and AWS.

* Your solution should install and configure Elasticsearch on three separate nodes. If you wish, you may use a configuration management tool
* The entry point to the cluster should be HTTP 9200/TCP
* The cluster should be adequately secured

## Context
We are testing your ability to implement modern automated infrastructure, as well as general knowledge of system administration. In your solution you should emphasize readability, maintainability and DevOps methodologies.
